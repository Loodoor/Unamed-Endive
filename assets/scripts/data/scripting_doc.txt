Documentation of the built-in methods of the module Unamed

Please do not delete the script 'register.py'. If you need to add a script to the game, just follow the documentation : https://github.com/Loodoor/Unamed-Endive/wiki/Scripting

Also, if you need to import files, use the lambda include, and not import (changing the current working directory via os.chdir will also change the cwd for the game and so it won't be able to load its resources !)

When you receive an event in the python scripting, it is a dict

To check the code of a key event, you can do ev['key'] == keys_ev_code.index('A') (will check if it is the key A)
