History
=======
You are a scientist and you arrive on Unamed, an island where a few people live. 
The only liveable places are situated near the ocean, or are really well protected, 
because the inhabitants don't have any creatures to defend themselves against the ones 
living in the centre of the island. You are going to settle down here after having seen 
one of your friend, a researcher, dying from an attack of creatures, and look for 
all these creatures to understand what was going on !

You will need to be patient to get out of the dungeons, and the best creatures possible !

Requirements
============
This game needs an up-to-date compiler for C++ and the SFML 2.4 to run correctly, if you want to install it from the source.

Otherwise, you just have to download the latest release working on your platform and run the game !

Compiling the project
=====================
If you want to compile the project, you will need to install the SFML lib as well Python 3.6, and call cmake, then make.
